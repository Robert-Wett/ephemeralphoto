#EphemeralPhoto
An application that publicly hosts images/files for a specified time until the file and link are unlinked.  

## Front-end TODO:
 - Create the form for uploads, with `drag and drop` functionality
  - On `drag`, auto-complete the path to local file and present options for `time` interval to expire.
 - Add AngularJS frontend
 - 
 

## Back-end TODO:
 - Add persistant store. I think we can start with SQLlite for now, in the vein of of local deploys. We can also add Mongo support relatively easy.
 - tons of other stuffs.
